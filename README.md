# LabyrinthClient
The client side code for the Distributed Labyrinth Game

Motivation:
For a school project we had to make a program that used Soquets.
I decided to make a game up to 8 players, where the players all spawned in a Maze and the goal was to reach the center as fast as possible.
After the school project I decided to improove the game by adding coins that players can collect while in the maze.

Commit: This project was coded in java using  the Netbeans IDE

How to execute: Just run the jar file, you'll need a LabyrinthServer programm to be running so you can connect to it
